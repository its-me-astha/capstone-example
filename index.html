   <li><h2>Education</h2></li>
   <p>There's more than one way to format your education section, 
    depending on the amount of work experience you have and what details
     may be most relevant to the job you're applying for. For each school you have
      attended, consider including some combination of the following
       (always include the three bolded items):
<ol>
   <li> School name</li>
    
    <li>Degree obtained</li>
    
    <li>Location</li>
    
    <li>Dates attended or graduation date</li>

    <li><h2>Skills</h2></li> 
    <p><h3>Hard skills vs. soft skills</h3>
        Employers are looking to hire employees who have the right mix of two different types of skills:
         soft skills and hard skills.</br>
        
        Hard skills are abilities specific to the job and/or industry.
         Generally, these are more technical skills you learn in school, 
         certification programmes, training materials or experience on the job.
          Hard skills might include proficiency in things like:<br>
        <ul>
        <li>Software ⭐⭐</li>
        <li>Foreign languages ⭐⭐⭐</li>
        <li>Operating certain equipment or machinery ⭐</li>
        <li>Communication ⭐⭐⭐⭐</li>
        <li>Customer service ⭐</li>
        <li>Problem-solving ⭐⭐⭐</li>
        <li>Time management ⭐⭐</li>
        <li>Leadership ⭐⭐⭐⭐</li>
        Hard skills are usually teachable while soft skills are typically personality 
        traits that are much harder to develop and therefore extremely valuable to employers.
         In most cases, your soft skills can enhance your hard skills. For example, if you're a
          detail-oriented software developer skilled in a computer programming language, you'll
           likely be able to catch errors and correct issues in the code you and your team create.<br>
        
        As a job seeker, it's important to highlight your best hard and soft skills to position yourself
         as a well-rounded candidate. It's also helpful to consider how the two types of skills relate
          to one another and the job so you can position yourself better in your next interview.</p>
